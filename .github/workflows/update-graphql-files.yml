# **IMPORTANT:** Do not change the FREEZE environment variable set here.
# This workflow runs every hour. To temporarily disable it (for example, during
# a docs freeze), add a secret to the docs repo settings called `FREEZE`
# with a value of `true`. To reenable GraphQL updates, delete the secret in
# the repo settings. The env variable here will evaluate whether the secret exists.
